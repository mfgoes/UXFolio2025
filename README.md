# CaseForge  

**A Dynamic Case Study Template for Showcasing Projects**  

CaseForge is a template-based site for structuring and displaying case studies. The current implementation focuses on watches, but the framework can be adapted for UX portfolios, product design showcases, and more.  

## Features  

- **Templated Case Studies** â€“ Predefined structure to present project details effectively.
- **Mobile-first styling using Bootstrap 5** â€“ Modern industry standard UI.  
- **Express-Powered Backend** â€“ Lightweight server setup to manage and serve content.  
- **Flexible Rendering** â€“ Hardcoded HTML currently, but planned enhancements for dynamic form-based case creation.  

## Current Status  

The project is in its **initial phase**, with case studies manually written in HTML. This approach helps visualize the UX structure before transitioning to a form-driven system.  

A future update will introduce a **section-based dynamic form** for defining case studies, allowing users to select:  
- Project details (name, year, client, banner)  
- Section types:  
  - Header + text + image  
  - Two images side by side  
  - Three images side by side  
  - Full-width quote  

This system will enable flexible, reusable case study pages. However, it is **not yet implemented** in the current version.  

## Tech Stack
